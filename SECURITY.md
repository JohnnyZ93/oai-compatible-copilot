## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open a public issue. Please report it privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/JohnnyZ93/oai-compatible-copilot/security/advisories).

We aim to respond within 48 hours. Keep it simple: just provide the reproduction steps and the potential impact.
